# Bazinga-2021-2022

Sept 22, 2021 - First update

              - Created basic teleOp, hardware map, and auto 

Oct 27, 2021  - Forgot to upload the code from the previous weeks

              - Finished almost all of teleop
              
              - Teleop works
              
              - Added a fifth wheel called "mid"
              
Nov 6, 2021   - Teleop and Autonomous
              
              - Strafing is complete (All of teleop is done)
              
              - Autonomous with encoders is starting 
              
              - Tarek is working on AutoAudienceBlue without encoders

Nov 10, 2021  - Testing

              - Forwards and backwards was reverse, issue fixed by making y positive in Teleop. Other than this, Teleop is working fine
              
              - Strafing works, only problems are mechanical ones
              
              - Autonomous with encoders is having issues with flipping the the right and left motors as well as the calculations to go a certain amount of distance.

Nov 13, 2021  - Autonomous with encoders

              - Hannah figured out how to incorporate encoders into the autonomous that Tarek created
              
              - Haven't been able to test any of the autonomous' due to the robot having mechanical complications
              
              - Changed some teleop controls
